<p>Heyo, I'm BLOK.</p>
<p>I am an experimental EDM/IDM artist, currently renovating. I also have interests in gaming, visual arts, and computer science.</p>
<p>I will mostly be working on Minecraft modding here and am currently learning Java, though sporadically.</p>
<p>If you're looking to collaborate, feel free to reach out. I will be particular on offers though as I tend to be fairly busy elsewhere. I'm not very adept with Java code yet, but I can certainly provide textures, models, data, and other visual and audio works, even music. Even if it's just to say hi, don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
