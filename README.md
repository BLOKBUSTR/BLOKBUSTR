Heyooo, I'm BLOK.

I am an experimental EDM/IDM artist, currently rennovating. I also have vast interest in visual arts, gaming, and computer science.
Music is an ever-expanding world, and there is always more and more to learn. I'm also currently learning Java on my own time, and I have prior experience from Scratch and Code.org. I'd like to use it to get into a bit of Minecraft modding in the forseeable future. I already have decent experience with creating resource packs for the game.
I will be very particular on collaboration offers. It will depend on how much time I'm able to spare, experience needed for the project and how time-sensitive it is, among other things. Don't hesitate to reach out though!
