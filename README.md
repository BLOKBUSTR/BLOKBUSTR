Heyooo, I'm BLOK.

I am an experimental EDM/IDM artist, currently rennovating. I have vast interest in visual arts, gaming, and computer science.

Music is an ever-expanding world, and there is always more and more to learn. I'm also currently learning Java on my own time, and I have prior experience from Scratch and Code.org. I'd like to use it to get into a bit of Minecraft modding in the forseeable future. I already have decent experience with creating resource packs for the game, including packs changing mod textures.

I will be very particular on collaboration offers. It will depend on how much time I'm able to spare, experience needed for the project and how time-sensitive it is, among other things. If it's any sort of casual, like-minded passion project, I usually wouldn't mind at all. I don't have confident coding skills just yet, but I'm definitely capable of creating visual and audio works. Even if its just to say hi, don't hesitate to reach out!
